<p>This year I created a course for a Sports Scientist that wanted to get into R. I taught the course in english via zoom once a week. I also developed a simple <a href="https://r4ds-sports.netlify.app/">course website</a> to organize the materials.</p>
<p>The course is an introduction to R with examples from Sports Science. The course is based on the terrific <a href="https://r4ds.hadley.nz/">R for Data Science</a> book with examples from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Basketball-Data-Science-Applications-Chapman/dp/1138600792">this book</a>. As a capstone project, we worked together on a project for his job:</p>

<p>All in all, this was a terrific experience. It was my first time teaching in English and the client was quite happy and we developed a very good working relationship. This is his feedback:</p>
