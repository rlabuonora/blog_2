<p>Over the summer, I decided to research how to use LLM’s for learning. I have been teaching economics, econometrics and data science for more than a decade, but never got any formal education. The first realization was that to use technology effectively, I needed to learn about the science of learning.</p>
<p>I found a couple of interesting youtube channels (Justin Su and Benjamin Keep). I also came across Math Academy. Justin Skycak has an in depth review of the scientific literature on learning.</p>

<h1>The Math Academy Way</h1>
<p>Ok, so the first thing I like about MA is that is designed to optimize learning,
based on what we know about how the brain works. Other technologies like schools, books, youtube videos and online courses are not. This principles are analyzed in depth in Justin’s book.</p>
<p>As a long time teacher, a lot of the science resonates with me and how I naturally do in the classroom. On the other hand, some of the principles are very hard to put into practice in a classroom setting, so we naturally pretend the do not exist.</p>
<div id="recognizing-information-vs.-learning." class="section level2">
<h2>Recognizing information vs. learning.</h2>
<p>In my early twenties, I discovered I loved learning. I started listening to podcasts and lectures on youtube daily, mostly about literature, history and economics. That way I learned a lot and discovered great teachers that inspired me to become a teacher myself. The best teachers were the ones that kept you engaged and were able to hold your attention for an hour, so that was what I tried to do in the classroom.</p>
<p>I didn’t realize that I was falling into the trap of passive learning. In this mode, you enjoyed listening to lectures a great deal, and you might even aquire some interesting general knowledge about the world, but it is pretty hard to develop useful skills this way.</p>
<p>As I got older, I became more interested in math and science, and also started worrying about learning something that would make some money. That is about the time where Coursera came out. I learned how to program with a few project based courses from Coursera that revolutionized the way I thought about learning.</p>
<p>I now see learning more about being able to do things than about increasing my knowledge. So, in order to learn, I spend as much time as possible practicing that skill.</p>

<div id="me-and-math" class="section level1">
<h1>Me and math</h1>
<p>I was always ok at math. I studied very little in high school, but managed to escape learning a few derivative formulas. As I advanced in my university courses, I got more interested and managed to get through Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics. I even took a few classed that required Differential Equations and Control Theory and did ok. After getting my degree, I taught Econometrics for a few years, so I was pretty good at statistics.</p>
<p>I always knew the building of my math knowledge had very shaky foundations. I had never seen complex numbers, trigonometry and geometry in a course, so had zero knowledge on those topics. I also had very little intuition for a lot of subjects I had studied.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, I have always had a growing interest in math, and realize how it underpins all the things I want to learn about. I pushed a bit to fill in those gaps, and even expand my knowledge a bit further.</p>

<div id="mastery-learning" class="section level1">
<h1>Mastery Learning</h1>
<p>Mastery learning means you do not progress to more advanced topics until you get very good at the prerequisites. This is one of the principles of Math Academy. You don’t get to choose which topic to learn. You enroll in a course and the system makes sure you know all you need to know.</p>
</div>
<div id="retrieval-practive" class="section level1">
<h1>Retrieval practive</h1>
<p>You are pulling information out of your brain. That is where the learning happens. If you ever go to the gym, an instructor shows you how to lift a weight. That is necessary for you to get in shape. But if you do not lift the weight yourself, you get zero results.</p>
<p>If you want to play the guitar, having an experienced teacher showing you how to play can be quite useful. It is still impossible to learn to play the guitar without playing one yourself.</p>
<p>MA lessons.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-is-math-academy-so-good." class="section level1">
<h1>Why is Math Academy so good.</h1>
<p>It build a very detailed model of you current knowledge, and points</p>
<p>Spending money is good. Having a roadmap and a precise measure of where you stand and where you are going is a powerful way of building a habits. Also, the XP system works. It doesn’t have to be fancy, just a short feedback loop that sends my brain the signal that I moved forward. You always have something to do on MA. Have 20 minutes? you can knock a lesson.</p>
<p>Tests are awesome.</p>
<p>Crucial insights from MA: Redundance for inflow of information is inefficient. I still think the best way to get the first exposure Redundance for outflow is not so bad.</p>
