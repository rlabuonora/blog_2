This year I created a course for a Sports Scientist that wanted to get into R. This is the [course website](https://r4ds-sports.netlify.app/). The course is an introduction to R with examples from Sports Science. Most of the examples are from [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Basketball-Data-Science-Applications-Chapman/dp/1138600792).

I also worked with the client to create some visualizations for his job:

This is a short clip from one of the workshops:

This is the client's feedback:
