This year I created a course for a Sports Scientist that wanted to get into R. I taught the course in english via zoom once a week. I also developed a simple [course website](https://r4ds-sports.netlify.app/) to organize the materials. 

The course is an introduction to R with examples from Sports Science. The course is based on the terrific [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) book with examples from [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Basketball-Data-Science-Applications-Chapman/dp/1138600792). As a capstone project, we worked together on a project for his job:

All in all, this was a terrific experience. It was my first time teaching in English and the client was quite happy and we developed a very good working relationship. This is his feedback:
