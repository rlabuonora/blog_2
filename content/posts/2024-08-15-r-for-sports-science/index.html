<p>This year I created a course for a Sports Scientist that wanted to get into R. I taught the course in english via zoom once a week. This is a short clip from one of the workshops. I also developed a simple <a href="https://r4ds-sports.netlify.app/">course website</a>.</p>
<p>The course is an introduction to R with examples from Sports Science. Most of the examples are from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Basketball-Data-Science-Applications-Chapman/dp/1138600792">this book</a>. The client wanted me to help on a project, so I create some visualizations for him also using <code>ggplot</code>:</p>

<p>All in all, this was a terrific experience. This is the clientâ€™s feedback:</p>
