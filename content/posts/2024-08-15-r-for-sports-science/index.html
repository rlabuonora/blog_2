<p>This year I created a course for a Sports Scientist that wanted to get into R. This is the <a href="https://r4ds-sports.netlify.app/">course website</a>. The course is an introduction to R with examples from Sports Science. Most of the examples are from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Basketball-Data-Science-Applications-Chapman/dp/1138600792">this book</a>.</p>
<p>I also worked with the client to create some visualizations for his job:</p>

<p>This is the clientâ€™s feedback:</p>
